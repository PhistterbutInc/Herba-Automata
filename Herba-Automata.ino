 * 
 * Welcome to Herba-Automata!
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * 
 * Created by Willie Phistterbut @PhistterbutInc or on thingiverse at thingiverse.com/phistterbut_inc/about
 * 
 * This firmware designed to control lighting, irrigation and a set of sensors for automated
 * indoor/outdoor farming using embedded systems
 * 
 * Released under MIT license.
 * Distibute/modify freely with attribution, no commercial use.
 * 
 * 
 * Planned Features:
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * support for arduino nano only, for right now. More to come perhaps
 * 
 * sensor interaction, including
 * daylight, soil moisture, air temp, humidity, maybe soil temp (cheap source?) sensors
 * 
 * relay interaction for lights and irrigation
 * 
 * customizable data logging
 * 
 * automated construction of spreadsheet information (??maybe??) 
 * 
 * internet capabilities, web page?
 * 
 * LCD screen support: 16x2, 16x4 i2c modules
 * 
 * real time clock for data logging
 * 
 * Hardware Planned/Required:
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Arduino board
 * Soil moisture sensor
 * Real time clock (premade OTS comp. or IC???)
 * Relay/s, Required for water/light control
 * Photoresistor, Optional, for logging sun data
 * Air temp./Humidity sensor, Optional
 * 
 * 
 *
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Included Features:
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Pretty much jack squat... except this page, I guess
 * 
 * hardware to come first!
