 * 
 * Planned Features:
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * support for multiple Arduino based boards (nano, mega, pro and duo at least)
 * 
 * sensor interaction, including
 * daylight, moisture, air temp, humidity, maybe soil temp (cheap source?)
 * 
 * relay interaction for lights and irrigation
 * 
 * customizable data logging
 * 
 * automated construction of spreadsheet information (??maybe??) 
 * 
 * internet capabilities, web page?
 * 
 * LCD screen support: 16x2, 16x4 i2c modules
 * 
 * Hardware Planned/Required:
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Arduino board
 * Soil moisture sensor
 * Real time clock (premade OTS comp. or IC???)
 * Relay/s, Required for water/light control
 * Photoresistor, Optional, for logging sun data
 * Air temp./Humidity sensor, Optional
 *
